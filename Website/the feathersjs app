-whenever the app is connected to node-red, it should join a channel where its content is distributed to all listeners, i.e. the front end as well and postman. 

-this, hence, should be manged via the express router, i.e. when ever you hit a specifc route, you should be able to listen to the stream

-on a stream event, i.e. a new sensor data, there should be a function that handles its input in the database. 

-there should be handler functions for queying the data and their pagination 

-there's two types of sensor data streams, the ones of heart rate and temp,, and the ones of the humidity and wather (this will be created with the socket manager)

-with the user controller everything should be the same as the other app

** user creation, user update, user deletion, login, protected routes and roles
